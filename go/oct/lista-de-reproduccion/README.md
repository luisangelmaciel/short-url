# EASY! YouTube  Video Player  with Playlist - JQUERY

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/mark_sottek/pen/zYWKzyx](https://codepen.io/mark_sottek/pen/zYWKzyx).

Quick, easy way to dynamically create and update YouTube playlists 
for iframe video embeds. Works for any iFrame embed.  Essentially, just
replacing one Iframe with another when a playlist button is clicked.

Simple, minimal mark-up.  Uses native YouTube iframe embed.  

When a button in the playlist is clicked 
the video iframe url  and video caption contained
in the button data attributes are written to and update their
respective fields in the video player mark-up -as follows:
#YouTube-Iframe (SRC) and #video-caption (HTML) 

Easy.

Oh. Integrated this player into Wordpress using ACF  if anyone is interested - let me know.
