# Hand OK ðŸ‘Œ

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/ainalem/pen/JLgWqa](https://codepen.io/ainalem/pen/JLgWqa).

Transforming hand to the "western" hand OK gesture. Demonstrates usage of morpihng to create realistic animations.

Disclaimer: This is meant to be the positive version of the gesture and has nothing to do with the negative connotations of the gesture. I hope nobody is offended by this demo!
