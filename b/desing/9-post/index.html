        <ul>
          <li>I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it.</li>
          <li>'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go.</li>
          <li>She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar.</li>
          <li>Thought you said that you would always be in love, but you're not in love no more.</li>
          <li>I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you.</li>

        <div class="lines"> </div>
        <ul>
          <li>We pretend that we just don't care, but we care.</li>
          <li>We're King and Queen of the weekend, ain't a pill that could touch our rush.</li>
          <li>I know this story by heart: Jack and Jill got fucked up and possessive when they get dark.</li>
          <li>Will you sway with me? Go astray with me?</li>
          <li>In the morning, you'll be dancing with all the heartache. And the treason, the fantasies of leaving.</li>

          <li>Blowing shit up with homemade dynamite, now you know it's really gonna blow.</li>
          <li>I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies... yeah, awesome right?</li>
          <li>Don't know you super well but I think that you might be the same as me.</li>
          <li>We'll end up painted on the road, red and chrome.</li>
          <li>Our rules, our dreams, we're blind, <br>
          Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired.</li>

          <li>I overthink your punctuation use,<br>
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do.</li>
          <li>I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush.</li>
          <li>Blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you.</li>
          <li>I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind. But what about love?<br>
Nothing wrong with it, super natural.</li>
          <li>A rush at the beginning; I get caught up, just for a minute.</li>

          <li>You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun.</li>
          <li>So I guess I'll go home into the arms of the girl that I love,<br>She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire.</li>
          <li>Every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone.</li>

          <li>Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us, before all of the winds of regret and mistrust.</li>
          <li>Three years, loved you every single day, made me weak, it was real for me.</li>
          <li>When you’ve outgrown a lover, the whole world knows but you. It’s time to let go of this endless summer afternoon.</li>
          <li>We're L.O.V.E.L.E.S.S generation, all fuckin' with our lover’s heads.
