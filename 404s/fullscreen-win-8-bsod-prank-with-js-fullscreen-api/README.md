# Fullscreen Win 8 BSOD prank with JS fullscreen API

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/helloluis/pen/rNKePKp](https://codepen.io/helloluis/pen/rNKePKp).

#HOWTO: 

1 - Click anywhere to enter Fullscreen (using the js fullscreen api). (because of prank reasons, clicking again will not exit fullscreen.)

2 - Wait a few seconds for the browser notice to disappear. While you wait, you may want to close any additional monitors your target might have opened.

3 - Yell something like "John, what's wrong with your computer?".

P.S. At about ~90%, the loader will freeze and the cursor will be visible, with the 'wait' skin, giving the illusion everything is frozen >:)

#Have fun!
