    <div class="text">The early 2000s saw the climb of fast fashion. With globalization, and the ability to cut costs through outsourcing, brands such as H&M and Forever 21 were able to mimic runway looks at a fraction of the cost. This resulted in the collapse of class structures defined by fashion. High and low trends were mixed, and as clothing became cheap, everyone was able to save up for designer accessories. At the turn of the millennium, men’s fashion experienced a brief “futuristic” wave. Black, silver, and metallic were in. Men wore leather outfits, puffy jackets, tracksuits, and Rockport boots.In the mid-2000s, styles sobered as the US entered war. Distressed denim became popular, along with military wear as everyday clothes. Popular colors included beige, rust, and forest green, and men wore low-rise jeans, light-colored polos, cargo pants, khakis, and short sleeved button-downs. Accessories such as white belts, aviators, trucker hats, flip-flops, Argyle print, and oxford shoes were also in. Suits became slimmer, and popular styles included black, navy, charcoal, and pinstripes. Nehru suits and Mandarin collars, inspired by James Bond and the Matrix, began to emerge. Men favored the smart casual look with flat front chinos, beige cardigans, Argyll pullovers, and houndstooth sports coats. Youth fashion was inspired by hip-hop and skater culture, mixing sportswear with high fashion. Sneakers, from Chuck Taylors to Nike Air Jordans, became hot items. At the same time, goth and indie pop subcultures developed. People became interested in vintage thrift store shopping and adopting a darker, rocker aesthetic–a twist on British mod. The early 2010s experienced a revival of ’20s prep style, along with an exponential rise in fast fashion and globalization. Smart casual looks, athleisure, along with hipster fashions were on trend. Does everyone remember the fedoras, non-prescription glasses, and rave bracelets of the recent past? These items seemed to signal our joint enlightenment as the human race. One love, y’all.
