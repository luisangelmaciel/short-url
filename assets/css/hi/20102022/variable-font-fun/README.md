# Variable Font Fun

Everybody's doing it! (Having fun with variables fonts that is.) I wanted to take them for a test drive myself, and added in a bit of rainbow glow while I was at it.

This is Roboto Variable font (aka Roboto VF) being animated with a simple loop and some CSS custom properties. I think the obvious next step would be to lose the js loop and convert this to a css-only animation.

Here's the link to Roboto VF:
