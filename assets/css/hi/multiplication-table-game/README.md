# Multiplication Table Game

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/tomhermans/pen/abVLELL](https://codepen.io/tomhermans/pen/abVLELL).

This is a remake of a game I made in 2010 that became very popular in Israel. I kept getting requests to bring it back to life, and now that my daughter is starting to learn about the multiplication table I decided to go ahead and recreate it.

The score is calculated based on the percentage of correct answers, the difficulty level, the size of the board, and the time. Good luck!
