	<h2 class="fs2 fw9 lh-title m-short">Come up with a good headline to start</h2>
	
	<p class="fs4 fw6 lh-copy m-short">A big idea that hints that here is something your reader really wants</p>
	
	<p class="fs5 lh-copy m">Now that you grabbed your reader's attention you need to interest them enough to keep reading. The right way to do that is to write a headline that appeals to their self-interest. So explain here the consumer problem your product solves.</p>
	
	<p class="fs5 lh-copy m">Because you want to generate empathy. So write from the consumer’s perspective. Avoid jargon. Write with your ears, use the same language your target audience uses. And position your product as the solution to the problem.</p>
	
	<h2 class="fs3 lh-title m-short">Highlight the benefits of using your product</h2>
	
	<div class="col">
	
		<p class="lh-copy m">And also prove them in some way that your product does what you say it does. This benefit is not as big as your number ONE benefit, but it is reason enough to persuade the reader to buy your product. This should be a functional and specific benefit. Like, "saves you $1,040/year", "Saves You 10 Hours a Week", "Lose 40 Pounds in 30 Days", "Learn how to code in 12 weeks." These are just examples, but you get the point.</p>

		<p class="lh-copy m">This should be a benefit to the consumer based on a product feature or a physical characteristic that makes your product special. Highlight specifics— facts, special features or anything the reader needs to know to make a decision. Remember this: In 2001, when Steve Jobs introduced the first iPod to the World, he didn't pull it out of his jeans pocket and say, "The iPod. A 5GB MP3 player". He said, "The iPod. 1,000 songs in your pocket."</p>
