# Contained Viewport Scaling

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/helloluis/pen/xxzVBmb](https://codepen.io/helloluis/pen/xxzVBmb).

A mixin that allows you to provide a min/max size to any property that can take a single value and scale between the two using viewport units. I originally wrote this to do a homemade min/max-font-size property.
