# Nerd Machine Logo: Animated

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/mandymichael/pen/adeKaa](https://codepen.io/mandymichael/pen/adeKaa).

10min Challenge: 
--has since been updated so not really 10mins anymore, I got carried away--
 
Converted a black and white jpeg to svg, broke apart and added css animations on the svg. Also picked out their colours and applied so that it matched their brand.

I added in animation and styling options so you can update the logo just for LOLs.
- Disco
- Batman
- Cool Dude
- Tada

ID not a class on the svg because there is only 1 Nerd Machine. #cssjoke.

Logo belongs to THE NERD MACHINE (No affiliation just a fan)
