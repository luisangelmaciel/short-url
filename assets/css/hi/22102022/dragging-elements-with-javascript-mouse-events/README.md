# dragging elements with JavaScript (mouse events)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/rachsmith/pen/vLMKvz](https://codepen.io/rachsmith/pen/vLMKvz).

Just a little pen to show how you can drag HTML elements (mouse events) with vanilla JS.
You could do the same thing with touchstart, touchmove and touchend to adapt this for touch devices.
